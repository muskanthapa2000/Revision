Promises vs Timer -> Promises take more pirority always no metter what the time interval is given 
setImmidate - > similar as setInterval with 0ms
I/O operations(readimg . writing) -> setImmediate will always take more priority then then setTimeout (with 0ms)
process.nextTick -> this take more priority then setImmediate, both inside and outside the I/O operator 

micro task queue -> take more priority and run immidate (promises , process.nextTick)
