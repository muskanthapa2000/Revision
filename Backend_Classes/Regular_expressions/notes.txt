### **What are Regular Expression Flags?**

Flags or modifiers are characters that enable advanced search features including case-insensitive and global searching. You can use them individually or collectively. Some commonly used ones are:

- `g` is used for global search which means the search will not return after the first match.
- `i` is used for case-insensitive search meaning that a match can occur regardless of the casing.
- `m` is used for multiline search.
- `u` is used for Unicode search.


. -> any single character  return true or false 
.. -> any plural character 
 + -> one or more repetation of previous character
^ -> string startes with character  /^x/ the starting startes with x character 
$ -> string ends with character /&x/ the string ends with c character   
[0-9] -> character between 0 to 9 will place their 
? - > The question mark symbol `?` matches **zero or one occurrence** of the pattern left to it.
{} -> Consider this code: `{n,m}`. This means at least `n`, and at most `m` repetitions of the pattern left to it.
**`|`** **- Alternation** -> Vertical bar `|` is used for alternation (`or` operator).
**`()`** **- Group** -> Parentheses `()` is used to group sub-patterns. For example, `(a|b|c)xz` match any string that matches either `a` or `b` or `c` followed by `xz`
**`\`** **- Backslash**-> Backslash `\` is used to escape various characters including all metacharacters. For example, `\$a` match if a string contains `$` followed by `a`. Here, `$` is not interpreted by a RegEx engine in a special way.
