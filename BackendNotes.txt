//    .................................................- What is Node Js? .....................

Node.js is an open-source, server-side, runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it well-suited for building highly scalable and efficient network applications.
Here are some key features and concepts associated with Node.js:
JavaScript on the Server:
Node.js allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript. This unifies the development language across the entire stack, from the front end to the back end, making it easier for developers to work on both client and server code.
Event-Driven and Non-Blocking:
Node.js is designed around an event-driven architecture, where various events (e.g., incoming requests, data streams) trigger corresponding callbacks. It uses a non-blocking I/O model, meaning that the runtime doesn't wait for I/O operations to complete before moving on to the next task. Instead, it queues up I/O requests and continues processing other tasks, which leads to high concurrency and efficiency.
NPM (Node Package Manager):
Node.js comes with npm, a powerful package manager that allows developers to easily install, manage, and share packages and libraries. npm has a vast ecosystem of open-source packages that can be used to extend and enhance Node.js applications.
Modules
Node.js uses a modular system, where code is organized into reusable modules. Built-in modules provide essential functionality, and you can create your own modules to keep code organized and maintainable.
Single-Threaded Event Loop:
Node.js runs in a single-threaded event loop, but it can handle a large number of concurrent connections. This is achieved through its non-blocking I/O, which allows it to efficiently manage multiple client requests at the same time without creating a new thread or process for each request.
Cross-Platform:
Node.js is designed to be cross-platform and can be used on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Use Cases:
Node.js is particularly well-suited for building real-time applications, such as web servers, chat applications, online gaming, and streaming services. It's also commonly used for building RESTful APIs, microservices, and serverless applications.



//    ................................................. middleware ................................

In the context of software development, middleware refers to software that acts as an intermediary between different applications or components. Middleware facilitates communication, data management, and interaction between disparate systems. It is commonly used in distributed systems to handle tasks such as authentication, logging, data transformation, and more.
In web development, middleware is often associated with frameworks and servers. In the context of server-side development, middleware functions are executed in the request-response cycle, intercepting and processing HTTP requests before they reach the final handler (e.g., a route handler) or after the response has been generated.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// Example Middleware
const logRequestMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Received a ${req.method} request to ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Call the next middleware or route handler
};
// Register Middleware for All Routes
app.use(logRequestMiddleware);
// Route Handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
// Another Middleware
const authenticateMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const isAuthenticated = /* Your authentication logic */;
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
};
// Register Middleware for a Specific Route
app.get('/protected', authenticateMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route.');
});
// Start the Server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
logRequestMiddleware:
This middleware logs information about each incoming request, such as the HTTP method and URL.
It calls next() to pass control to the next middleware or route handler in the chain.

authenticateMiddleware:
This middleware checks whether a user is authenticated. If authenticated, it calls next() to allow the request to proceed to the route handler for the protected route. If not authenticated, it sends a 401 Unauthorized response.

app.use():
This method registers middleware to be used for all routes. In this case, every incoming request will pass through logRequestMiddleware.

Route Handlers:
Route handlers define the logic for responding to specific HTTP requests. In the example, there are route handlers for the root (/) and a protected route (/protected).
