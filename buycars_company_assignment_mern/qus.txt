Context and Background
BUYC Corp is a marketplace for second-hand cars. Dealers list their inventory of second-hand cars on buycars.com. Buyers can look at the inventory and buy the car from buycars.com.

Low Level Design and API Creation

• Phase II - Improve this specification to make it concrete for junior engineering team (Time: 25-30 mins)
o Design the Tables and Schemas
